@drprofessorsoso208,"Esteemed colleague,<br><br>It is with a profound sense of gravitas that I observe the current predicament of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose actions have culminated in an egregious self-humiliation and a catastrophic degradation of his own standing within the echelons of political esteem. In an audacious display of misdirected ire, he has sought to cast aspersions upon the Indian government, attributing the degradation of his reputation to external forces rather than acknowledging the inherent culpability of his own misguided allegations. <br><br>This phenomenon—wherein individuals resort to spurious claims as a means of self-justification—inevitably invites scrutiny and, often, unwelcome exposure. Such occurrences serve as a poignant reminder of the inexorable truth that those who engage in the fabrication of unfounded allegations often find themselves ensnared in a web of embarrassment, ultimately reaping the consequences of their own actions. Thus, one might argue, the travails of Mr. Trudeau are a fitting, albeit unfortunate, manifestation of this recurrent narrative. He endeavors to undermine the reputations of others through the dissemination of baseless allegations, yet now finds himself lamenting the deterioration of his own standing. What a profound irony, indeed, illustrating the quintessential folly of engaging in such duplicitous tactics.<br>😂😂😂",2024-10-27T07:12:58Z,0

@saturo_nipon,"be it US or Canada, there is no political side that is favorable to India. They are a uniparty countries, fooling their own people as liberal vs conservative. On the other hand, complex democratic India&#39;s political situation heavily impacts US/Canada&#39;s business deals. Say for example, Modi didnt allow US made vaccines during covid. He even ensured that most supplies are met domestically. That is roughly $500B potential loss to the deep state run establishment. They cried a lot about India back then. Had it been a different government, they would have ensured India is totally sold out. This is the reason why they tried their best interfering in India&#39;s elections to remove Modi. So much so that Soros openly funded anti India narratives and bragged about it. And regarding India Canada trade relations, they are not of a huge deal. They can afford to lose it for the traction this sensationalism gets. It certainly deflected the actual interference that helped the true dough government. Now that the Kalistani narrative has been set, they can become targets if needed, to put more pressure on Indian government.",2024-10-26T10:40:57Z,0

Our government is like behind the &quot;innocent plumbers &quot; from other countries as per the great Justin Trudeau(ofcourse no evidence shown but for instance yes ok but is he really innocent then no country goes behind normal plumbers like that come on Trudeau you have list of dossiers in which their is long list of wanted goons which you have collected and havent extradiated even after proofs who are actually not innocent plumbers but terrorists,rapists,murderers and also members of extortion and drug rackets. Please check carefully there are members of Bishnoi gangs also in the list which you havent extradiated and now accusing that our government is working with them come on wake up there are not one not two but many gangs you have actually collected in your country and they are fighting between themselves ).

@Sharan-wl9sq,I am born and brought up in india Though i now live in dubai but in my early early teenage i got live in Canada and that way way back in early 2000s from 2001 to 2007 and that canada was way different than todays i was like heaven on earth . Nice people mostly original polite canadian whites and very less third world immigrants. Crime was very uncommon but had stared to rise. Great food and freezing winters. Everyone also earned good and Everyone could find a job easily and buy a house easily . But then canada suddenly flooded with third world immigrants and it started to fall apart. Though i moved to dubai in 2007 i regularly catch up with my old friends in canada who are mostly original white canadians and they tell me the shithole canada is becoming and now seeing these vidoes of India vs Canada makes much more sense. Canada need strict immigration policies . I miss that 90s and early 2000s Canada 🇨🇦 .,2024-10-20T07:36:50Z,0
@ZoaRalte,Trudeau and his wokeism.....the patience of Canadians! Letting him and an organization listed as terrorist by the world&#39;s largest democracy run your country. Your patience and tolerance will mark the end of Canada (look at what liberals have done to Europe and the States).

@anirbannayak6993,"Because you&#39;re a native Canadian national buddy, as an Indian I want to give you some serious all. I guess this is not a thing of debate, that how U.S financed Al-Queda to conduct guerilla attacks on Soviet Union in Afghanistan. That was the first emergence of terrorism, which has become a global headache now. At that time America thought it would end there in Afghanistan. But the same snake which they had created to fulfill their dirty desires, bite them back as the 9/11. A tragedy in which common people suffered only; not those high table members. Then to kill that snake, they spent almost 2 trillion dollars overall. Whose money it was : the tax collected from common people. Finally they found that snake near Pakistan, whom they were giving the money to find out that snake. I hope you got the irony here. And if you do a little bit of research, you will find that India warned U.S each and every time they had used those illegal organizations and means, which were hidden from commons and completely illegal and immoral. But they ignored those warnings to achieve their short-term dirty dreams. Canada or more accurately to say Justin Trudeau is doing the same. And native Canadians may think that it&#39;s completely India&#39;s matter and all. Yes, may be if your government keeps on spending their whole money and time to create problems in India to supress India, in the place of focusing their own national issues of common Canadians facing in their daily lives, they will be successful to do it to some extend; but I can confirm you the illegal immigrants,terrorists, for whom your government is doing all this drama, will become a biggest headache for Canada in future. Justin Trudeau is not going to be there, but the Canada and it&#39;s common citizens will be there to suffer the consequences of Justin&#39;s dirty politics of today.  If, (1) celebrating the killing of Indira Gandhi, Prime Minister of a sovereign democratic country India.(2) insulting and taking down the national flag of India from Indian High-Commisionar&#39;s office in Canada (3) Giving threats to spread terrorism in India, live on camera, standing on American soil (4) If announcing open contract to kill Indian diplomats in Canada (5) organizing chaotic rallies in your country,holding Khalistani flag and causing inconvenience to other Canadians; are not freedom of speech for you, then please step out on streets and protest to extradite these terrorists.

We’ve gone from labeling the Khalistan movement (Babbar Khalsa) as a terrorist organization, to electing one of their sympathizers to high status in Parliament, and we’ve opened our doors to their separatist movement to run their affairs against India from behind our borders. We’ve had bombers that killed an entire Air India 747 airliner full of passengers off the Irish Coast, and there’s now more Sikh representation in our parliament per ratio capita than anywhere else in the world. All this in less than 50 years. Yeah, I can understand why the Indians would be over here taking care of their business. If Canada would ever put demands on their Sikh immigrants to behave and take serious the reports from their counterparts in India regarding potential criminal acts they are about to commit, might go a long way to “keeping Canadians safe”.

He&#39;ll bring in another 10 million immigrants before the election and pay them. Good money to live here in exchange for votes. That&#39;s all. The clown is. Him and drugs don&#39;t go together very well do they. And what about all that cocaine they found on his plane? What happened to it to the liberal party? Use it all up already and need another batch.

That&#39;s because they take the money for the liberal party and have orgies and big parties instead while paying others to create climate change. Like starting fires on purpose etc etc. Maybe weather modifications. One man one idiot is destroyed. Canada. Investors are running away. People are pulling the money out of here.

@hansbehrmann8152,"The American is right and has  hit the nail on the head with his observations  as well as the Indian diplomat. I certainly agree with  Trudeau being described as a lightweight he simply does not have the intellect or political acumen  to be a Prime Minister and should be removed as quickly as possible, if not immediately  The harm that he is inflicting in some ways is quite straightforward and in others  they are subtle and it is this subtle harm that will take a very long time to repair.  At this point as it is  possibly only affecting Canada I am sure  the US is  just watching for any spillover that may affect them.  I am surprised that the American Ambassador or an Envoy from the US has not met with Trudeau and told him to get his house in order or there will be serious repercussions. That Trudeau&#39;s minister of Security contacted the US  to advise them of what we know about the threat is  simply nonsense . The US intel services  from the CIA, Military , Homeland Security , FBI  probably know  100 percent more about what is going on than we ever will .  They have probably  sent information to him that he has ignored. As several who have   commented have noted, this is probably a distraction from the huge scandal of the the green slush fund investigation that has brought to light what an absolute failure this government in an obscene display of corruption . Trudeau is scrambling or grasping at anything that will take the spotlight off his  possible  complicit criminal conduct. In short his verbal diarrhea  that he ejects into the world is becoming an irritation as well as irrational . The Indian diplomat I believe has it right when he says he is on a   constant high, what else would explain his , for lack of a better term, stupid statements.",2024-10-17T13:02:03Z,1

@garywagner2466,"Let’s all have a good laugh remembering the Trudeau family’s first trip to India, all dressed up in orange costumes and pretending to be locals. The dimwitted expression on Sophie’s face made me laugh out loud, and that was nine years ago. What were they thinking? The Trudeaus were completely tone deaf to their own blatant racism and arrogance. The Indian government and public could not believe what they were seeing, and were bemused. How things have changed! Trudeau has ruined the long-standing relationship between Canada and India. His family is in tatters. Sophie the devoted airhead is long gone. His government is despised by most Canadians. Even his own caucus wants him to resign. But even better, Justinder Trudeauiwal has learned nothing.",2024-10-17T12:58:12Z,0

I&#39;m one of the people there for encored psychoelectronic attacks on our countries. They franchised by 1987 into other countries and communications between international rap groups. I&#39;m one of the targets for many groups who will attack my sectors Canada being one of them. 1978 at Kennedy&#39;s grave I was beamed at.

It&#39;s one thing for a nation to annoyed with another country, but for them to be speaking that way about a group in Surrey, and Quebec for that matter, is no laughing matter. India is far from a Bastian of truth and stability in the world and so I would think twice before finding amusement in their rhetoric. Canada has a whole truck load of image based damage control to do, but we shouldn&#39;t be mistaken in thinking that a nation like India is all talk and no action.",2024-10-17T10:28:57Z,2
